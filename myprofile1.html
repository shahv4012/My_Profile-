            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Amirul Shah Bin Md Rosli, a dynamic and detail-oriented professional with a strong background in both data analytics and quality assurance. My journey began with a focus on Mechanical Engineering at Politeknik Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin from 2021 to 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I serve as a Data Analytics professional at AirAsia@Ground Team Red SDN BHD, where I am instrumental in managing and analyzing operational data to drive efficient decision-making. My expertise lies in developing and maintaining user-friendly live dashboards using Google Sheets and MySQL, facilitating real-time data visualization and reporting for staff performance and resource allocation. I am adept at consolidating and validating staff data to ensure accuracy in primary data sources and utilize advanced formulas and data management techniques to streamline processes. Furthermore, I contribute to seamless operations by monitoring system and network performance, ensuring optimal IT infrastructure functionality within a fast-paced environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to my current role, I gained valuable experience in Quality Assurance at KYB-UMW SDN BHD from 2021 to 2024. There, I was actively involved in quality assurance and equipment maintenance, responsible for inspecting and evaluating mechanical components to ensure compliance with quality standards. My responsibilities included the calibration and upkeep of precision measurement instruments, routine maintenance of production machinery, and systematic troubleshooting of equipment issues. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify root causes of defects and implemented corrective and preventive actions. This role significantly enhanced my technical proficiency in equipment handling, strengthened my analytical and problem-solving capabilities, and provided extensive exposure to quality control processes in a high-volume manufacturing setting.
